## 🔧 Configuration

### Google Analytics Setup

1. Create a Google Analytics 4 property in your [Google Analytics account](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Go to: Admin → Data Streams → Web
3. Create a new stream or select an existing one
4. Copy your Measurement ID (starts with "G-")
5. Add your Measurement ID to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
```

### Content Management

All content is managed through JSON files in the `content` directory. Each language has its own subdirectory containing:

- `profile.json`: Personal information
- `metadata.json`: SEO and site metadata

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new directory in `content/` with the language code
2. Copy the JSON files from an existing language directory
3. Translate the content
4. Update `lib/i18n/config.ts` to include the new language

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com).

1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. Import your project to Vercel
3. Vercel will detect Next.js automatically and configure the build settings
4. Your app will be deployed to a production URL

### Other Deployment Options

You can also deploy to other platforms that support Node.js:

1. Build your application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

2. Start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

This portfolio website includes several performance optimizations:

### Compression & Caching

- **Gzip Compression**: Enabled by default in Next.js for all responses
- **Static Asset Caching**: Long-term caching for static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- **Browser Caching**: Optimized cache headers for different content types
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and WebP conversion

### Bundle Analysis

To analyze your bundle size:

```bash
npm run analyze
# or
yarn analyze
# or
pnpm analyze
```

### Additional Optimizations

- **Turbopack**: Fast bundler for development (enabled with `--turbopack`)
- **Static Generation**: Pages are statically generated at build time
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better loading performance
- **Font Optimization**: Optimized Google Fonts loading with Geist
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code elimination

### Performance Headers

The application sets several performance-related headers:

- `Vary: Accept-Encoding` for compression negotiation
- `Cache-Control` headers for optimal caching
- Security headers for enhanced protection
