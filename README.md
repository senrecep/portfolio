## 🔧 Configuration

### Content Management

All content is managed through JSON files in the `content` directory. Each language has its own subdirectory containing:

- `profile.json`: Personal information
- `metadata.json`: SEO and site metadata

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new directory in `content/` with the language code
2. Copy the JSON files from an existing language directory
3. Translate the content
4. Update `lib/i18n/config.ts` to include the new language

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com).

1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. Import your project to Vercel
3. Vercel will detect Next.js automatically and configure the build settings
4. Your app will be deployed to a production URL

### Other Deployment Options

You can also deploy to other platforms that support Node.js:

1. Build your application:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```
